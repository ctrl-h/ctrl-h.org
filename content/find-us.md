**We are at**: [7600 N. Interstate, Portland, OR 97217](https://www.google.com/maps/preview?q=7600+N.+Interstate,+Portland,+OR+97217&ie=UTF-8&hq=&hnear=0x5495a7afd1fd13fd:0x8ee897b6b9d8ee43,7600+N+Interstate+Ave,+Portland,+OR+97217&gl=us&ei=yf7yU_2iHsL2oASe-YEI&ved=0CB4Q8gEwAA).

**From I-5**: Exit Lombard. Turn West (Left if north, Right if south). Go one block to Interstate. Drive north one block, Ctrl-H is at the northeast corner of N. Interstate and Russet. Look for many guys with beards.  Plenty of free street parking is available.

**By light rail (MAX)**: Take the YELLOW LINE north on Interstate to the Lombard exit. The space is just across Interstate to the east.  Get the Yellow Line schedule [here](http://trimet.org/schedules/maxyellowline.htm).

**PLEASE NOTE:** at the moment the space is not constantly staffed.  Please check ahead on IRC or by posting a message to the google group before showing up.  Usually someone is around on the weekends, but this is not guaranteed.
